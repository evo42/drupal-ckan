This is a Drupal [http://drupal.org] module that integrates Drupal with CKAN [http://www.ckan.net/]

Right now it's in an early state of development.

I've worked on similar modules for clients and wanted something clean I could quickly release - and this is the result.

But it isn't yet production quality code and should be subject to review and test before use.

If you do find bugs please report them (along with any patches) at http://github.com/practicalweb/drupal-ckan/issues



To use it download Drupal and install it.

Then add the module as usual in sites/all/modules/ckan/

You will now have the ability to use your Drupal site to search for CKAN packages - and store comments etc about the packages in your site.
