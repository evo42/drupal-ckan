This is a Drupal [http://drupal.org] module that integrates Drupal with CKAN [http://www.ckan.net/]

To use it download Drupal and install it.

Then add the module as usual in sites/all/modules/ckan/

You will now have the ability to use your Drupal site to search for CKAN packages - and store comments etc about the packages in your site.
